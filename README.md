# Continental's HFL110 ROS Driver
This package was designed to be a [Robotic Operating System (ROS)](https://index.ros.org/about/) driver for [Continental's 3D Flash Lidar products](https://www.continental-automotive.com/en-gl/Passenger-Cars/Autonomous-Mobility/Enablers/Lidars/3D-Flash-Lidar).

Please [review the source code documentation](https://continental.github.io/hfl_driver/index.html) for more details on how the project is structured.

## Quickstart

Install like any other ROS package:
```
sudo apt install ros-<ros-distro>-hfl-driver
```
**Note:** there may be a delay from when new code is available in this repository to when it will become available via apt.

## Install from source

First, make sure your system is supported and already has ROS installed (see table above)

Go ahead and clone this repository into your `catkin_ws`.
```
# url
git clone https://github.com/continental/hfl_driver.git
# ssh
git clone git@github.com:continental/hfl_driver.git
```
Read up on `catkin_ws` by [following this tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace).

From your `catkin_ws` directory, use `rosdep` to install dependencies rosdep install hfl_driver:
```
rosdep install hfl_driver
```

Within your `catkin_ws` directory, go ahead and compile the code:
```
catkin_make
# with tests
catkin_make run_tests
```

After a successful compile, add the new HFL ROS packages to your environment:
```
echo "source <path/to/your/catkin_ws>/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

In two separate terminals, run the following commands.

Terminal 1:
```
roscore
```

Terminal 2:
```
roslaunch hfl_driver hfl110dcu.launch
```

[Parameters](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/arg) for hfl_driver launch file

| Parameter           | Description           | Default Values        |
| ------------------- | --------------------- |:---------------------:|
| camera_model        | HFL Model to launch   | hfl110dcu             |
| camera_version      | HFL Firmware version  | v1                    |
| camera_ip_address   | HFL IP address (IPv4) | 192.168.10.21         |
| frame_data_port     | HFL PCA Port          | 57410                 |
| computer_ip_address | Computer IPv4 Address | 192.168.10.5          |

**TIP**: check a launch files arguments before calling roslaunch to confirm you are passing the correct parameters.

**TIP**: If you cannot connect to the sensor, use [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) or another network tool to see if you are receiving packets.

Be sure to check the [documentation website](https://continental.github.io/hfl_driver/index.html) for more information.

## CPP static code analysis

ROS also comes with static code analysis support, therefore in order to run it for the hfl_driver package, type:
```bash
catkin_make run_tests roslint_hfl_driver
```
This will output the errors and warnings on console.
If more info is required see [this](http://wiki.ros.org/roslint).
