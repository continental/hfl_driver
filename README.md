# Continental's HFL110 ROS Driver
This package was designed to be a [Robotic Operating System (ROS)](https://index.ros.org/about/) driver for Continental's 3D Flash Lidar products.

Please [review the source code documentation]() for more details on how the project is structured.

## Getting Started
1. First, make sure your system is supported and already has ROS installed (see table above)
2. Go ahead and clone this repository into your `catkin_ws`. Read up on `catkin_ws` by [following this tutorial(http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace).
3. Within your `catkin_ws` directory, go ahead and compile the code:
    1. `catkin_make`
    2. **you may have to run [dos2unix](https://www.poftut.com/how-to-install-and-use-dos2unix-command-in-linux/) on the `hfl_driver/cfg/HFL.cfg` file in order to get it to compile**
4. After a successful compile, add the new HFL ROS packages to your environment:
```
echo "source <path/to/your/catkin_ws>/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
5. In two separate terminals, run the following commands:
      1. `roscore`
      2. `roslaunch hfl_driver hfl110dcu.launch`

[Parameters](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/arg) for hfl_driver launch file

| Parameter           | Description           | Default Values        |
| ------------------- | --------------------- |:---------------------:|
| camera_model        | HFL Model to launch   | hfl110dcu             |
| camera_version      | HFL Firmware version  | v1                    |
| camera_ip_address   | HFL IP address (IPv4) | 192.168.10.21         |
| frame_data_port     | HFL PCA Port          | 1900                  |
| computer_ip_address | Computer IPv4 Address | 192.168.10.5          |

**TIP**: check a launch files arguments before calling roslaunch to confirm you are passing the correct parameters. Use [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) or another network tool to see if you are receiving packets.

Be sure to check the documentation website for more information.

## CPP static code analysis

ROS also comes with static code analysis support, therefore in order to run it for the hfl_driver package, type:
```bash
catkin_make run_tests roslint_<name_of_ros_package>
```
Where in this case you would put hfl_driver or udp_com in for <name_of_ros_package>.
This will output the errors and warnings on console. If more info is required see [this](http://wiki.ros.org/roslint).
